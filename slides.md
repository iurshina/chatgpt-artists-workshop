### Slide 0: Writing with AI: Empowering Artists & Researchers with ChatGPT



---

### Slide 1: Who I Am & How I Use ChatGPT

- Hi, I’m Ana – ML engineer, I also like to read ✨
- I use ChatGPT to:
  - Write tech proposals & project descriptions
  - Motivation letters & outreach emails
  - Get feedback on my poetry (mostly to feel better)
  - Remove errors and typos from any text

---

### Slide 2: What is ChatGPT / an LLM?

- ChatGPT is a **Large Language Model** (LLM) – it completes text based on patterns in its training data.
- It's like **a very powerful autocomplete**, not a search engine.
- It does not “think” or “understand” – it *predicts the next word*.

---

### Slide 3: Core Limitations

- ✖️ **Confidently wrong** (“hallucinations”)
- ✖️ Lacks real-world experience or emotional nuance
- ✖️ Struggles with **long-term consistency**
- ✖️ May reflect **biases and clichés** in training data

---

### Slide 4: Basic Use

- Start simple:
  - “Write a 300-word artist statement about…”
  - “Summarize this grant call for me”
- Use the right model:
  - GPT-4o: good for most purposes
- **Context length**: GPT-4o can process \~128,000 tokens with Pro. That’s about:

  &#x20;   📄 \~300 pages of text

  &#x20;   📚 \~100,000 words

---

### Slide 5: Prompt Engineering 101

- 🧠 Be specific: topic, audience, tone, length
- ✨ Use roles: “You are a grant-writing coach…”
- 📄 Use structure: bullet points, sections, examples
- 🔁 Iterate: “Rewrite to sound more poetic…”
- 🧪 Paste your own text for style mimicry

---

### Slide 6: Advanced Examples

- "Rewrite this email as a compelling pitch to a curator"
- "Draft a concept note for a socially engaged media installation on migration"
- "Suggest 3 themes in my project that would appeal to public funders"
- "Turn this messy brainstorm into a 1-page artist statement"

---

### Slide 7: Limitations (Again)

- People may recognize AI-written text:
  - Overly smooth, generic phrasing
  - Repetitive or vague
- Watch for:
  - Bias in tone/language
  - Clichés ("art has always questioned society")
  - Empty inspiration quotes 😉

---

### Slide 8: Common Syntax & Punctuation Patterns

- 📍 Em dashes everywhere — often for emphasis or rhythm
- 📍 Comma-heavy, especially in lists and long clauses
- 📍 Balanced sentence structures with symmetry
- 📍 Overuse of transition words (however, thus, while, etc.)
- 📍 Rarely uses fragments or abrupt shifts — everything is “clean”
- 📍 Tends to write in perfect grammar — but sounds overly smooth or impersonal

### Slide 9: Writing in Your Style

- Paste your past work & ask: “Analyze my writing style”
- Then: “Write about XYZ in the same style”
- Tip: Ask it to describe your tone first, then apply it to new drafts
- Great for: artist bios, mission statements, funding appeals

---

### Slide 10: Web Search with ChatGPT Pro

- Yes, ChatGPT Pro can access the web (if you ask!)
- Great for:
  - Finding current open calls and residencies
  - Looking up real stats, policy quotes, orgs
- Tip: Say “Search the web for…” or “Find me current…”

---

### Slide 11: Deep Research Mode (ChatGPT Pro)

- OpenAI’s  Deep Research tool lets ChatGPT:
  - Autonomously search the web
  - Read and analyze multiple sources (text, PDFs, images)
  - Produce structured, nuanced research reports
- Designed to mimic the work of a human analyst, but faster
- Can take 5–30 minutes per task; access rolling out to Pro users

### Slide 12: Q&A + Live Prompt?

- Any questions?
- We can also write some prompts together&#x20;
