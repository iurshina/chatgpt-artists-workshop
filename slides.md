### Slide 0: Writing with AI: Empowering Artists & Researchers with ChatGPT

- Welcome!

---

### Slide 1: Who I Am & How I Use ChatGPT

- Hi, I’m Ana – ML engineer, I also like to read ✨
- I use ChatGPT to:
  - Write tech proposals & project descriptions
  - Motivation letters & outreach emails
  - Remove errors and typos from any text or messages
  - Get feedback on my poetry (mostly to feel better)
  

---

### Slide 2: What is ChatGPT / an LLM?

- ChatGPT is a **Large Language Model** (LLM) – it completes text based on patterns in its training data.
- It's like **a very powerful autocomplete**, not a search engine.
- It does not “think” or “understand” – it *predicts the next word*.

---

### Slide 3: Core Limitations

- ✖️ **Confidently wrong** (“hallucinations”)
- ✖️ Lacks real-world experience or emotional nuance
- ✖️ Struggles with **long-term consistency**
- ✖️ May reflect **biases and clichés** in training data

---

### Slide 4: Basic Use

- Start simple:
  - “Write a 300-word artist statement about…”
  - “Summarize this grant call for me”
- Use the right model:
  - GPT-4o: good for most purposes
- **Context length**: GPT-4o can process \~128,000 tokens with Pro. That’s about:

  &#x20;   📄 \~300 pages of text

  &#x20;   📚 \~100,000 words

---

### Slide 5: GPT-4o and GPT-4.5 – What's New?

- **GPT-4o** (released May 2024):
  - Multimodal: accepts and generates text, images, audio, and video
  - Faster, cheaper, and more responsive
  - Available to free-tier users with rate limits; higher limits with Plus
  - Ideal for creative tasks, image input/output, and real-time AI use

- **GPT-4.5** (released February 2025):
  - Improved reasoning and coding accuracy over GPT-4o
  - Fewer hallucinations, more consistent output across tasks
  - Stronger performance in scientific, legal, and analytical use cases
  - Available via ChatGPT Pro and enterprise integrations

*The AI model lineup evolves quickly – check for the latest.*

### Slide 6: Prompt Engineering 101

- 🧠 Be specific: topic, audience, tone, length
- ✨ Use roles: “You are a grant-writing coach…”
- 📄 Use structure: bullet points, sections, examples
- 🔁 Iterate: “Rewrite to sound more poetic…”
- 🧪 Paste your own text for style mimicry

---

### Slide 7: Advanced Examples

- "Rewrite this email as a compelling pitch to a curator"
- "Draft a concept note for a socially engaged media installation on migration"
- "Suggest 3 themes in my project that would appeal to public funders"
- "Turn this messy brainstorm into a 1-page artist statement"

---

### Slide 8: Limitations (Again)

- People may recognize AI-written text:
  - Overly smooth, generic phrasing
  - Repetitive or vague
- Watch for:
  - Bias in tone/language
  - Clichés ("art has always questioned society")
  - Empty inspiration quotes 😉

---

### Slide 9: Common Syntax & Punctuation Patterns

- 📍 Em dashes everywhere — often for emphasis or rhythm
- 📍 Comma-heavy, especially in lists and long clauses
- 📍 Balanced sentence structures with symmetry
- 📍 Overuse of transition words (however, thus, while, etc.)
- 📍 Rarely uses fragments or abrupt shifts — everything is “clean”
- 📍 Tends to write in perfect grammar — but sounds overly smooth or impersonal

---

### Slide 10: Writing in Your Style

- Paste your past work & ask: “Analyze my writing style”
- Then: “Write about XYZ in the same style”
- Tip: Ask it to describe your tone first, then apply it to new drafts
- Great for: artist bios, mission statements, funding appeals

---

### Slide 11: Web Search with ChatGPT Pro

- Yes, ChatGPT Pro can access the web (if you ask!)
- Great for:
  - Finding current open calls and residencies
  - Looking up real stats, policy quotes, orgs
- Tip: Say “Search the web for…” or “Find me current…”

---

### Slide 12: Deep Research Mode (ChatGPT Pro)

- OpenAI’s  Deep Research tool lets ChatGPT:
  - Autonomously search the web
  - Read and analyze multiple sources (text, PDFs, images)
  - Produce structured, nuanced research reports
- Designed to mimic the work of a human analyst, but faster
- Can take 5–30 minutes per task; access rolling out to Pro users

---

### Slide 13: What Are Custom GPTs?

- Custom GPTs are tailored versions of ChatGPT with:
  - Special instructions (like personality, goals, tone)
  - Optional uploaded files for added knowledge
  - Access to tools (code interpreter, web, DALL·E, etc.)

- Anyone can create one using the **GPT Builder**:
  - No coding required — just describe what you want
  - Configure behavior, knowledge, and capabilities
  - Test and refine it in real-time

- Used for:
  - Writing assistants, tutors, life coaches, HR bots
  - Art portfolio reviewers, grant writing partners, UX advisors

---

### Slide 13: Are Custom GPTs Better?

- ✅ **They can be** — if well-designed:
  - Stay in character and stick to specific domains
  - Work faster by skipping broad generalizations
  - Handle niche tasks better than generic ChatGPT

- ⚠️ **But**:
  - Quality depends on good setup and clear instructions
  - Not smarter than GPT-4o — just more focused
  - Can still hallucinate if not properly grounded

- 🧪 Examples:
  - "Expert Grant Proposal Writer" (haven't tried myself)
